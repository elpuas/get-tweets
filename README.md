get-tweets
==========

A PHP + JS solution for retrieving your most recent tweets to display on your website.

### Reason

I wrote this quick solution based on Twitter's blogger.js. The JS functions in my source borrow heavily from their logic. When Twitter released it's new V1.1 API and retired V1, it broke my site (and many others). I am mostly putting this on github to store for myself, but if it helps you out, great! My class leans on codebird-php to do the, now required, OAuth lifting.

### What does it do?

You can use this combo of PHP + JS to grab your most recent tweets and display them on your website. Depending on the parameters passed, you can include retweets and choose the number of tweets to display.

### Requirements

This solution requires the following which are not included in this repo:
* Webserver running PHP 5.3 or higher with PHP cURL and PHP OpenSSL enabled
* jQuery http://jquery.com/ (tested w/ v 1.7.2)
* codebird-php https://github.com/mynetx/codebird-php (tested w/ v 2.4.1)
